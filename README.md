<b>Objective:</b> Create a basic 2D game in which a player has to recolect all the objects and exit.

The player should be able to move in these 4 directions: up, down, left, right. You must use the W, A, S and D.

The map can be composed of only these 5 characters: 0 for an empty space, 1 for a wall, C for a collectible, E for a map exit, P for the playerâ€™s starting position.

The map must be closed/surrounded by walls.

# BONUS
<li> Make the player lose when they touch an enemy patrol. </li>
<li> Add some sprite animation. </li>
<li> Display the movement count directly on screen instead of writing it in the shell. </li>
