Objective: Create a basic 2D game in which a player has to recolect all the objects and exit.

The player should be able to move in these 4 directions: up, down, left, right. You must use the W, A, S and D.

The map can be composed of only these 5 characters: 0 for an empty space, 1 for a wall, C for a collectible, E for a map exit, P for the player’s starting position.

The map must be closed/surrounded by walls.

# BONUS

• Make the player lose when they touch an enemy patrol.

• Add some sprite animation.

• Display the movement count directly on screen instead of writing it in the shell.

# Instruccions
