<b>Objective:</b> Create a basic 2D game in which a player has to recolect all the objects and exit.

<li> The player should be able to move in these 4 directions: up, down, left, right. You must use the W, A, S and D. </li>
<li> The map can be composed of only these 5 characters: 0 for an empty space, 1 for a wall, C for a collectible, E for a map exit, P for the playerâ€™s starting position. </li>
<li> The map must be closed/surrounded by walls. </li>

<h2> Bonus </h2>
<li> Make the player lose when they touch an enemy patrol. </li>
